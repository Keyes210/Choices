# Choices
ORIGINAL, complete. A decider; slightly better than a coin flip.


Choices is a decision maker. I often find myself confronted with trivial decisions. What am I going to get for lunch? Which TV show am I going to try? What movie from my ever-growing Netflix queue am I going to finally watch. It’s nice to take these things out of my hands, and not think about them. That’s what Choices does.

Users can add items to a list, and Choices will pick one. If not pleased with the outcome, they can try again with one click. If it’s something that comes up frequently, users can save their lists to use later.

There’s also a random number generator.

Users enter their item right in the toolbar. Text input, where it exists, is limited to 25 characters. In the toolbar, users are actually prevented from adding more text. When saving ChoiceLists, exceeding the limit is indicated by a color change in the submit button.

For both the list of choices and the list of ChoiceLists, users can delete items individually or all a once with a button in the toolbar.
